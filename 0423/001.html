 A: We frequently work with large companies and start-up clients offering products and services that are relatively new to the world.
But no matter how cool a product or service — users who find it confusing won’t be able to grasp how much it can help them, and they’ll simply move on. A poor first impression is a common barrier to entry that can be avoided with the help of rich and compelling visual explanation and/or instruction.
Introduce yourself
For many of our clients with multi-faceted products and services, we recommend creating a product introduction video that explains what the product/service is, what it does, and how it makes your customers’ lives better — all in a clear, engaging way.
For a product introduction video that hits hard:
Know your audience
Storytelling is key
Invest in quality talent, voice-over and/or animation
Shorter is better
